    "description_1": "Homeoagora comes from the mixture of \"Homeo\" which is a combined form that appears in the Greek that means \"equal\" or \"similar\" and \"Ágora\" that it was a central public space in the ancient Greek cities. The literal meaning of the word is \"place of meeting\", \"assembly\" or \"meeting\". Therefore, its combined meaning would be \"Meeting of Equals\"",
    "description_2": "Most of the medicine we practice today is not a relationship of equals. In allopathic medicine, when a doctor prescribes a medicine he does not see his patient as a unique human being but as a statistic, something which is limited in a study group with a specific treatment.",
    "description_3": "On the other hand, homeopathy is a medical science based on the law of similarity. This law refers to the way we get sick and get well. However, one of the main foundations of this medicine is that each patient is unique and has a unique remedy based on their individuality.",
    "description_4": "Homeoagora is built to give homeopathic doctors and the patient a space to interact. So that doctors can promote themselves and share their experiences. Each doctor has a unique experience with their patients, so each publication has great value for other doctors, patients and future homeopaths. In addition, this application will provide all the tools so that doctors can handle all the information of the patient, appointments and recipes."

    "about_description_1": "After forty years of experience as a Homeopath, he affirms that his mind, heart and spirit are at the service of this medicine. The renowned Venezuelan doctor clarifies all the doubts about this medical science.",
    "about_description_2": "Today, most of us do not know anything more than the traditional medicine with which we have always been treated and the thousands of mass-produced medicines available around the corner at any pharmacy. Homeopathy, a science that is more than 200 years old, is nowadays gaining strength due to the impotence of traditional medicine in solving the health problems of the human being. In this exclusive interview with Homeoagora, Doctor Risquez, with more than four decades practicing Homeopathy, gives us his vision about this science.",
    "about_description_3": "Diego Risquez Harris is a surgeon, graduated from the University of Zulia with a post-graduate degree in pediatrics at the Pédiatrica Clinic of the University of Rome. He was a founding member of the Venezuelan Foundation of Homeopathic Medicine. In 1969 he had his first contacts with Homeopathy, and since 1973 he has been attending private consultations such as Homeopath, in Caracas, Venezuela. He is the author of the books Homeopathy, Vitalist Medicine and Reflections. Coming from a family of recognized doctors, trained in allopathic medicine, he is currently one of the most consulted homeopathic doctors in Venezuela.",

  "answers":{
    "answer1":"Homeopathy is a medical therapeutic science based on the law of similarity, that is, what a substance in a state of dynamism is able to produce in a healthy human being, that same substance is capable of curing that patient who manifests his illness with symptoms similar to what that substance produced in the experimentation. The second law, the dynamisation, Hahnemann used to extract the toxic effects of the substances by subjecting them to a process of dilution and succussion called dynamisation. And are these substances in a dynamic state, which are subjected to the process of experimentation in healthy humans to get all the symptoms. This is the third law, the law of pure experimentation in healthy subjects. The fourth law says that only one medication should be used for each treatment. The fifth law tells us about miasmas, which is the way we designate our predispositions to get sick. The law of healing - the sixth law - tells us that the human being gets sick from the inside out and heals in the same way, from the inside to the outside. And finally, the seventh law tells us that no human being is identical to another. The application of these seven laws to cure a sick person is Homeopathy.",
    "answer2":"The father of Homeopathy was Samuel Hahnemann, who was born in Meissen, Germany in 1735 and died in Paris in 1843 at 88 years of age. He graduated as a doctor and for the treatment of diseases, drugs were used at that time, which were mostly poisonous and violent. They were administered in toxic doses, all based on mercury, arsenic, sulfur and chlorine. This leads him to study the pharmacopoeia, an area very unknown by the doctors of the time, since it was the apothecary of the people who administered the medicines. One day he decides to abandon the practice of his profession due to his inability to cure, and he dedicates himself to the translation of books. Translating a book about Quina, also known as \"powder of the countess\" or \"dust of the Jesuits,\" he comes up with the great idea that if she can cure malaria it means that by administering it to a healthy individual she must produce the same symptoms, so he decides to experiment in himself and the law of similarity is born. This is how homeopathy was born in 1789.",
    "answer3":"Because I was tired, because all people are not equal, and the medicine has become very scientific and does not take into account that we are all unique. I remember yesterday that I had done the record to a patient who had visited several doctors, and he told me: \"Nobody had asked me what my character is like, how was my childhood, how my marriage is going, nobody has talked about anything with me, they just ask me about my symptoms and they prescribe me a pill.\"",
    "answer4":"A child at birth brings a virgin immune system which, when in contact with the harmful agents, reacts by elaborating specific antibodies against the invading agent and many of these antibodies persist for a lifetime. So many vaccines make this immune system weaken and that's why so many children with asthma and allergies come. It can not be denied that the discovery of vaccines has been very useful in eradicating great epidemics that were plaguing humanity, but after that discovery - that of smallpox - the same concept has been applied to tuberculosis, leprosy, triple, polio, antitifica, viral trivalent, the influence for the gripe, among others. We have already received vaccines for children since the birth in mass form in the last 30 years and that makes them have the immune system so deteriorated. I personally, for the treatment of polio, I have been using Karwinskia Humboldtiana for 10 years, Pertussinum for pertussis, etc. There are for each of these diseases their respective homeopathic vaccines.",
    "answer5":"Many patients and their families have asked me for my opinion and advice on how to act in a cancerous process, and I always tell them that I can not give them any guarantees, as I believe that no doctor can give it, be it a homeopath or an allopath. I only give my opinion and advice according to the case that is presented. Sometimes I suggest leaving it alone with homeopathic treatment, and I have seen healing and surprises in some cases evicted by traditional medicine. I believe that all doctors have had this experience, and in other cases at least have a happy end to earthly life with homeopathic treatment, and not as it sometimes happens in patients undergoing surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with large sufferings and the cost that this causes, to have the same end.",
    "answer6":"Be a doctor graduated from a university. Although it should be taught in universities that there is another way to treat the sick. There are many people who dedicate themselves to homeopathy without being a graduate doctor, however, as one teacher told me, the best homeopaths that he had seen were those who came from allopathy, because they had extensive training as a doctor and came very disappointed from traditional medicine.",
    "answer7":"The homeopathic doctor must be an integral doctor, a family doctor, that is, a family health counselor, because knowing his members, he knows the miasmas that predominate in a given family. Many times, you become a psychiatrist and spiritual counselor of their patients.",
    "answer8":"I attend to everyone. I recently had a case of an 87 year old old woman with asthma and I treated her with homeopathy and she spent her last years of life healed.",
    "answer9":"Many patients begin their healing process with the first medication, and continue to use it, others need a sequence of remedies according to the symptoms, which change and therefore I suggest that a patient who begins with homeopathy should give himself a Prudential period of one year to see the results of a treatment. There are others who with a single medication come into balance and do not return until 2, 3 or 4 years later, when they begin to feel discomfort again.",
    "answer10":"All. It is that you are not going to treat the diseases, you are going to treat the sick person. And this is how the true healing should be.",
    "answer11":"Allergies and respiratory problems are the most common. Although I have treated many cases of arthritis, headaches, ulcers, hypertension, among others, very successfully.",
    "answer12":"People should take homeopathy in health, even pregnant women receiving homeopathy get benefits on the fetus, thus improving their miasmatic predisposition to get sick and contributing to eugenics (application of biological laws to perfection of the human species).",
    "answer13":"Paragraph 9 of Hahnemann's Organon tells us: \"In the state of health, the vital force that animates dynamically the material part of the body, exerts an unlimited power. She sustains all parts of the organism in an admirable vital harmony, both with respect to activity and sensitivity, so that the spirit endowed with reason, which resides in us, can freely employ these free and healthy instruments to achieve the lofty object of our existence, \"and I would say that homeopathy has the capacity to restore us to that state of health in order to achieve the high purpose of our existence, which is to be able to give ourselves without expecting anything.",
    "answer14":"Not at all. Many of my patients came reluctant and skeptical at the first consultation, and have already been with me for 10 years and have also brought their children, siblings, parents, the whole family.",
    "answer15":"To finish I would like to tell you that allopathy is the medicine of the masses, and homeopathy is the medicine of the individual."
